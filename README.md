**Dear Insitec MIS Candidate,**

**Thank you for making the time to have a crack at our little coding challenge!**

In this repository we have provided you with a simple Visual Studio project for you to use as the starting point for the challenge. Create whatever files you feel are necessary to develop the solution... But please don’t change too many project settings (especially the build artefacts) or you might upset our checking tools.

Generally we will give candidates a week to work on the challenge, don’t stress it if you can't finish it in time... It's actually pretty dam evil! Do your best and work through the bits you can, if you have not already guessed this is one of those "show us how you work and approach problems" type problems so please be ready to share your screen with us in the follow up session and walk us though your solution.

So what is the challenge? We want you to write a program that lists the steps necessary to solve a [slide puzzle](https://www.helpfulgames.com/subjects/brain-training/sliding-puzzle.html). Simple right? Well it would be but the catch is that the slide puzzle is given to the application as a bitmap image. The other requirements and constraints for the application is as follows:

- The application must be developed in C++.
- The application must not use any external libraries.
  - stdlib being the one exception.
- The application must take a single argument where:
  - The argument is a path to a file.
  - The file format will be a [24bit bitmap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format).
- The application must write to std out:
  - The moves the blank tile must make to unscramble the image.
  - Each move should be recorded as one of; up, down, left or right.
  - Each move should be written on a new line.


We have prepared some sample image files for you to test your program with, you can find them [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Insitec-MIS/Sample-Puzzles/main/Sample_01.bmp) and [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Insitec-MIS/Sample-Puzzles/main/Sample_02.bmp). If you do not normally develop on windows or with Visual Studio download and run the windows 10 dev image from [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/), it will have everything you need to get going quick. If something is unclear or you have any questions please reach out to us via email at <mis-development@insitec.com.au>.

Thanks again for giving it a crack, we hope you have some fun with it and we look forward to the follow up session to walk through your solution.

Cheers,

   The Insitec MIS Engineering Team
